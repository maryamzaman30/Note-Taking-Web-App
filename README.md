## Introduction 

For our Midterm and Final team project in the fourth semester, our team designed and developed a math-based note-taking application as part of a collaborative Agile project. The application integrates mathematical tasks within a single interface, featuring a scientific calculator, graph plotting capabilities and an equation solver, all embedded in a real-time note editor. This eliminated the need to switch between external tools or tabs. Our goal was to enhance focus and productivity for students and professionals working on math-intensive tasks. Throughout the project, we followed Agile methodology, conducting regular standups, sprint planning and backlog product to ensure iterative progress and strong team coordination.
